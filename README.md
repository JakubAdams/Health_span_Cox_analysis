With this code I aimed to calculate the effect sizes (if any) prescription drugs may have on healthspan.
To this end, Cox proportional hazards models were run between healthspan, defined as time from enrollment

Electronic health record data linkage was used to ascertain prescriptions and diagnoses.

properties like methylprednisolone, naproxen, diclofenac among others.
